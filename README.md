# Instructions

Before running any code dependencies must be installed. To do this, run:

`.paket/paket.exe install`

> On Mono, use `mono .paket/paket.exe install` instead.

To run [Fable](http://fable.io) samples, [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed in the system.
You can install JavaScript dependencies by running:

`npm install`

For chapters 5 and 6, just use [F# interactive](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/articles/fsharp/tutorials/fsharp-interactive/)
to run the code in the `.fsx` script files. For the rest of the chapters, see the `README.md`
file in the respective folders.
